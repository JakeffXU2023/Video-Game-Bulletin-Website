Executive Summary
The Video Game Bulletin (VGB) is a proposed web-based platform that provides
timely announcements about upcoming and newly released games and consoles. Its goal
is to offer users a simple, organized, and interactive way to stay updated on releases. By
adopting a full-stack JavaScript approach, this project simplifies development, ensuring a
streamlined and efficient process. Expected outcomes include a fully functional release
calendar, the ability to filter by genre, and features for compatibility checking.
Background
In the current digital landscape, game enthusiasts often encounter overwhelming
and scattered information about new releases across various platforms. This makes it
difficult to track the games they care about. VGB addresses this issue by creating a
centralized and streamlined hub that focuses exclusively on relevant, upcoming releases,
making it easier for users to access accurate and organized information.
Project Description

1. Objectives
The project aims to create a user-friendly web application that delivers
concise game release information, allows users to filter games by genre, and
provides previews of early reviews and system requirements.
2. Scope
The system will feature a release window calendar, search and filtering
tools, and a display for game details, including platforms and specifications. The
database will be updated in real time to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the
platform will support user interactions, such as account creation, favoriting
games, and commenting on upcoming releases.

3. Methodology
The development approach will utilize core web technologies including
HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling, along with a full-stack JavaScript
framework such as Next.js or Gatsby, built on React. This will unify the front-end
and back-end development under a single language. The Firebase database will
be used for data storage, simplifying API connections and ensuring real-time data
flow.

Conclusion
By the end of the semester, The Video Game Bulletin is expected to be a practical
and efficient solution for game enthusiasts alike. By adopting a simplified technology
stack, the project will not only deliver a high-quality product but also demonstrate the
team's ability to apply modern, streamlined web development practices to create a
meaningful, real-world application.
