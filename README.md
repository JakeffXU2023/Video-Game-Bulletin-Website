# Video-Game-Bulletin-Website
A CSCC 21 Project (Along with portions of ITCC 14 and ITCC 33 as a Side-Project backing this main project) to be maintained and pass sooner. Private.

To initialize:
Go through your VSCode and open up a folder containing the frontend and backend. If it doesn't initially exist, create a folder (name it whatever, but for easier management sake, name it VGB Website).
Now that the folder configuration has been setup properly, do the VSCode thing again and open up a folder. This should let you work on the backend and frontend.
Before anything else, make sure you have Node_Modules installed, to make the node servers work. If the command in the Terminal Node server.js fails, put in 'npm install'. It should install the Node_Modules.
Now that's done, go do node server.js and open up the server. After doing so, go live. The website should work as is.

If you want the Firebase Configurations, message Percy Bray (ME) in Messenger. I don't trust y'all to use my links.
